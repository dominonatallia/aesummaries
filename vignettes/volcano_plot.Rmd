## 1. Introduction

This document details the steps for creating Volcano Plot using CVARS application which is a graph report. The required input ADaM data for this is an ADAE dataset.

### 1.1 Report Inputs in App

Upon loading the CVARS  application, please select the `Data Source`and load the `ADAE` data.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("adaeenter.png")
```

Upon loading/selecting `ADAE` data and clicking the Report Inputs tab, report inputs can be added.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("adae_report_input.png")
```

  - Report Type as `Figure` and Report Name as `Volcano Plot` for the graph  
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("volcano_plot_new_1.png")
```

**Treatment/Population**  
*Required*  

  - Under Treatment and Population Selection, select appropriate `Treatment Variable`:   
    For table, Treatment Variable determines the columns and for Figure, determines how to         differentiate groups by color.
    
  - Select appropriate `Treatment Sort Variable` which will give the order for sorting             Treatment variable.
  
  - To subset entire data based on population flags, select `Population Filter`. eg. Overall,      Safety (SAFFL).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}

```


**Processing Data:**  

  - Add or Edit the default `Analysis Subset Condition` and `Denominator Subset Condition` to      filter input data (for calculating categorical counts alone or for entire data                 respectively)
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("event_analysis_03.PNG")
```

  - Select `Adverse Event Filter(s)` - To filter input data

  - Select `Period` - To generate the figure by either `Overall Duration` or `Other`.
  
  - Select `Summary By` - It helps to select either `Participants` if the plot is to based on subject count or `Events` if the plot is to based on AE counts.
  
  - Select `Lower Level Event Term` - This variable will help to generate the figure by           AEBODSYS or FMQ Name etc., It is a type of scatterplot that shows statistical significance (P-value) versus magnitude of change (fold change).
  
  - Select `Lower Level Event Term` - This variable will help to generate the figure by           AEDECOD or AELLT etc., It is a type of scatterplot that shows statistical significance (P-value) versus magnitude of change (fold change). 
  
  - select `Measure of Association` - To generate the plot by either `Risk Ratio` or `Risk Difference`.
  
  - Select `Control Group` - To choose the control treatment to compare with treatment 
  
  - Select `Treatment Group` - To choose the treatment to compare with control
 
  - Update the `p Value Cutoff`, `Alpha Value(CI)`, `Risk Reference Lines` and `Cutoff of Incidence (%)` as desired to generate the plot. 
 
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("volcano_plot_02.PNG")
```

**Graph Output:**

- Click `Process Report Input` button and switch to `Graph Output` tab to generate the graph.

  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("volcano_plot_03.PNG")
```
